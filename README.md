### What is GraphQL?
- GraphQL is a syntax that describes how to ask for data, and is generally used to load data from a server to a client. GraphQL has three main characteristics:

    - It lets the client specify exactly what data it needs.
    - It makes it easier to aggregate data from multiple sources.
    - It uses a type system to describe data.

With GraphQL, the user is able to make a single call to fetch the required information rather than to construct several REST requests to fetch the same.

### What is Rest API?
- REST determines how the API looks like. It stands for “Representational State Transfer”. It is a set of rules that developers follow when they create their API. One of these rules states that you should be able to get a piece of data (called a resource) when you link to a specific URL.

### Why use GraphQL?
- GraphQL lets you ask for what you want in a single query, saving bandwidth and reducing waterfall requests. It also enables clients to request their own unique data specifications.

### Advantages over Rest API?
- Fetching data with a single API call.
- No over- and under-fetching problems. 
- Tailoring requests to your needs.
- Autogenerating API documentation.

### What is a GraphQL schema?
- GraphQL server uses a schema to describe the shape of your data graph. This schema defines a hierarchy of types with fields that are populated from your back-end data stores. The schema also specifies exactly which queries and mutations are available for clients to execute against your data graph.

### What are resolvers?
- A resolver is a function that resolves a value for a type or field in a schema. Resolvers can return objects or scalars like Strings, Numbers, Booleans, etc. If an Object is returned, execution continues to the next child field. If a scalar is returned execution completes.
